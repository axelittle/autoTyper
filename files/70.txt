Typewriter patents date back to 1713, and the first typewriter proven to have worked was built by Pellegrino Turri in 1808 for his blind friend Countess Carolina Fantoni da Fivizzono. Commercial production, however, began only with the writing ball of Danish pastor Malling Hansen (1870). This device looked rather like a pincushion. The mother of Nietzsche and his sister once gave him one for Christmas. He hated it. Christopher L. Sholes, a Milwaukee newspaperman, poet, and part-time inventor, was the main creator of this machine. The Sholes Glidden typed only in capital letters, and it introduced the QWERTY keyboard, which is still in use today. The keyboard was probably designed to separate frequently-used pairs of typebars so that the typebars would not clash and get stuck at the printing point. The SG was a decorative machine, boasting painted flowers and decals. It looked rather like a sewing machine, as it was manufactured by the sewing machine department of the Remington arms company.
